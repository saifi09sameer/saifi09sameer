Hi there

I’m Sameer Saifi, currently working as an SDE 2 at Airtel Payments Bank. I have around 3 years of experience in backend development, mainly focusing on building scalable and reliable systems. My work revolves around Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and SQL, with hands-on experience in Kafka, Docker, and RESTful APIs. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean code and efficient design. I’m also exploring Kubernetes and cloud-native development to strengthen my understanding of modern infrastructure and deployment practices.
